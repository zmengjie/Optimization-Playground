    Welcome to the **Optimization Playground**!

    This app is divided into three sections:
    1. **Guide** â€“ Introduction to optimization concepts and how to use the app.
    2. **Taylor Series** â€“ Learn how first- and second-order Taylor expansions relate to optimizers.
    3. **Optimizer Playground** â€“ Experiment interactively with different optimizers and functions.

    ### ðŸ“š How Taylor Series Explains Optimizers
    Many optimization algorithms are grounded in the **Taylor series expansion**, which provides a local approximation of a function using its derivatives.
    - **First-order Taylor expansion**: Forms the basis of **Gradient Descent**.
    - **Second-order Taylor expansion**: Used in **Newton's Method** to accelerate convergence.
