Welcome to the **Optimization Playground**!

This app is divided into three sections:
1. **Guide (this page)** â€“ Introduction to optimization concepts and how to use the app.
2. **Taylor Series** â€“ Learn how first- and second-order Taylor expansions relate to optimizers.
3. **Optimizer Playground** â€“ Experiment interactively with different optimizers and functions.

### ðŸ“š How Taylor Series Explains Optimizers
Many optimization algorithms are grounded in the **Taylor series expansion**, which provides a local approximation of a function using its derivatives:
- **First-order Taylor expansion**: Forms the basis of **Gradient Descent**.
- **Second-order Taylor expansion**: Used in **Newton's Method** to accelerate convergence.
